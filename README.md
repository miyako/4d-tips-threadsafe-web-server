## modifications

* support interpreted mode (processing code is moved to compiled component)
 
the original HDI was using an undocumented feature, where "use preÃ«mptive web process" in user settings would override that of structure settings.  

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no" ?>
<preferences stamp="4">
	<com.4d>
		  <web>
			  <standalone_server>
				<configuration session_mode="2"/>
				<options>
				      <web_processes preemptive="true"/>
				</options>
			</standalone_server>
		</web>
	</com.4d>
</preferences>
```
in the current version, the strategy does not work.
